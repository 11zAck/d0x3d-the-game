This is the start of a print-and-play "lite" version of [d0x3d!], 
only back of the tile cards to save some paper, 
and only 2 cards of rules.

print-and-play-lite.xcf:
	one page per level
	
print-and-play-lite.pdf:
	and already builded version to be printed, only 16 pages

Improvements to this are welcome.
