This is the start of a print-and-play "lite" version of [d0x3d!], 
with only the backs of the deck cards to save some paper, 
and only two rule cards.

print-and-play-lite.xcf:
	One page per level.
	
print-and-play-lite.pdf:
	An already built version to be printed, only 16 pages.

Improvements to this are welcome.
